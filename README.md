# Kontagion-
Kontagion Game

Kontagion was developed using the OpenGL framework and C++.

An arcade-like game, Kontagion is designed to be fun for all! Play as Socrates, a scientist stuck in a Petri dish whose sole mission is to exterminate the evil bacteria. Blast the bacteria with disinfectant spray or flamethrowers to progress to increasingly difficult levels and maybe even achieve high scores! 

Move Socrates using left/right keys and shoot the bacteria using the enter or space bar.
